Dots for my setup.

Ignore the ```.DS_Store``` file because it is something with MacOS I can't figure out.

Note:
    - Put the stuff in ```Ubersicht-widgets/``` into your ubersicht folder.
    
    - I have deactivated ```pecan-workspace-jsx``` because it didn't really work for me.
    
    - I have deactivated ```xanthia-image-coffee``` because of the same reason as the previous one, but if they both work for you you can keep them enabled in       the menu bar.
    
    - Some emacs and vim color schemes dont work with my alacritty dracula setup so I have commented the scheme that kinda works.(Im working on it ðŸ¥²)
